# Trezor Suite Verify and Install üîó

These scripts can be used to verify and install [Trezor Suite](https://trezor.io/trezor-suite "Trezor Suite") on Linux.

The scripts will allow you to easily verify and install another version of Trezor Suite whenever needed.

> All of the Trezor source code is open source including the firmware on device, but they recently partnered with [Wasabi Wallet](https://wasabiwallet.io/ "Wasabi Wallet") and integrated their CoinJoin implementation which sends data to blockchain analysis companies. If this is a concern for you, then never connect your Trezor or any of your other bitcoin wallets to any of Trezor's nodes within Trezor Suite or don't use a Trezor device at all. When connecting your wallet to a node you expose your xpub to the node which means they can derive and view any public address that you will ever use with the wallet. This means Trezor can potentially share this with Wasabi who can then potentially share this with blockchain analysis companies (not saying this is happening but there's a possibility it can). If you prefer to not use a Trezor, then look into using a [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/ "Ledger") which runs closed source firmware (not ideal) or a [Coldcard](https://coldcard.com/ "Coldcard") which has viewable, editable, and verifiable source code and only supports Bitcoin.

## Verify the Scripts ‚úîÔ∏è

Before running the verification and installation scripts for Trezor Suite you should verify the scripts. This will minimize the possibility of the scripts being compromised. To perform the verification you'll need to have `gnupg` and `curl` installed which are most likely already installed on your system, but if not here's how to install them:

### gpg

#### Arch

```sh
sudo pacman -S gnupg
```

#### Debian/Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt install -y gnupg
```

### curl

#### Arch

```sh
sudo pacman -S curl
```

#### Debian/Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt install -y curl
```

Now you need to import the public key that signed the manifest file which you can do by running the following command:

```sh
curl https://keybase.io/codemonkeystech/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

You're now ready to verify the manifest file. You will need to have the `trezor-suite-verify-and-install-manifest.sha512sum` and the `trezor-suite-verify-and-install-manifest.sha512sum.asc` files which should be in the same directory as the scripts from downloading the repository.

To verify the manifest file run the following command:

```sh
gpg --verify trezor-suite-verify-and-install-manifest.sha512sum.asc
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```sh
gpg: assuming signed data in 'trezor-suite-verify-and-install-manifest.sha512sum'
gpg: Signature made Tue 09 May 2023 06:40:16 PM EDT
gpg:                using RSA key FCFFD7771CCA9DC3A75EB51AD70C28777CBE04A5
gpg: Good signature from "Jay the Code Monkey <jaythecodemonkey.7vk7i@slmail.me>" [ultimate]
gpg:                 aka "Jay the Code Monkey <c0dem0nkeys@pm.me>" [ultimate]
gpg:                 aka "[jpeg image of size 3958]" [ultimate]
Primary key fingerprint: B7E6 FB94 A589 876C CFC2  1E4B 1E07 E75C 19F1 AE0E
     Subkey fingerprint: FCFF D777 1CCA 9DC3 A75E  B51A D70C 2877 7CBE 04A5
```

> Unless you tell GnuPG to trust the key, you'll see a warning similar to the following:

```sh
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
```

This warning means that the key is not certified by another third party authority. If the downloaded file was a fake, then the signature verification process would fail and you would be warned that the fingerprints don't match.

When you get a warning like this it's also good practice to check the key against other sources, e.g., the [Code Monkeys Keybase](https://keybase.io/codemonkeystech "Code Monkeys Keybase") or the [Code Monkeys Blog](https://codemonkeys.tech/contact/#primary-pgp-key-%F0%9F%94%90 "Code Monkeys Blog").

You have now verified the signature of the manifest file which ensures the integrity and authenticity of the file but not the verification and installation scripts.

To verify the verification and installation scripts you'll need to recompute the SHA512 hashes of the files, compare them with the corresponding hashes in the manifest file, and ensure they match exactly which you can do by running the following command:

```sh
sha512sum --check trezor-suite-verify-and-install-manifest.sha512sum
```

If the verification was successful you should see the following output:

```sh
./install-trezor-suite.sh: OK
./verify-trezor-suite.sh: OK
```

By completing the above steps you will have successfully verified the integrity of the verification and installation scripts, so you can now run the scripts whenever you need to verify and install another version of Trezor Suite.

> If for some reason you believe the scripts you have downloaded have been compromised on your machine you can always rerun the above commands again to ensure the integrity of the files.

## Encrypt the Scripts üîê

To mitigate the possibility of anyone tampering with these scripts you can encrypt the files using, e.g., [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/ "GnuPG").

### Encrypting the Files

```sh
gpg -c verify-trezor-suite.sh
```

```sh
gpg -c install-trezor-suite.sh
```

### Decrypting and Extracting the Files

```sh
gpg verify-trezor-suite.sh.gpg
```

```sh
gpg install-trezor-suite.sh.gpg
```

## Tips when Making Online Purchases üïµÔ∏è

It's a good idea whenever buying a hardware wallet online (as well as everything else) to use as little Personally Identifiable Information (PII) as possible.

This will mitigate the leaking of PII to the company, any third parties they may be using with their site, hackers, governments, etc.

Here are some tips when shopping online to help you preserve your privacy:

  - You should conceal your IP address when visiting the website or any websites related to the product you're purchasing by using a trusted VPN that you ideally paid for privately, that is open source, claims to not log, etc., e.g., [IVPN](https://www.ivpn.net/ "IVPN") or [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en "Mullvad")

  - You also have the option of using [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/ "Tor") to conceal your IP address and if the site offers an onion address you should use it

  - Provide only the minimum amount of information that is required to complete the purchase and don't set up an account unless required

  - Use a pseudonym for your name, an aliased/burner email, an aliased/burner phone number, etc.

  - Don't use your home address or any other address that is easily tied to you for shipping instead use a P.O. box, UPS box, Amazon box, a random address not associated with you, etc.

    - You should set up the mailing solution with as little PII as possible as well

  - Use a private payment method

    - Prepaid cards ideally bought privately, e.g., with cash

    - Use virtual cards using a service like [Privacy](https://privacy.com/ "Privacy") (closed source)

    - Gift cards ideally bought privately, e.g., with cash

    - Money order

    - [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/ "Bitcoin") using privacy best practices

    - [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/ "Monero")

> The above suggestions are not an exhaustive list and do not guarantee you will remain anonymous when purchasing or using the products. There are always trade-offs between privacy, security, convenience, cost, etc., so consider your threat model and come up with a solution that works best for you.

## Tips when Running Trezor Suite üïµÔ∏è

Here are some tips when using Trezor Suite to help you preserve your privacy:

  - Conceal your IP address using a trusted VPN or Tor as described in the above section

  - Use your own node or a node you trust if possible, e.g., when transacting with Bitcoin to prevent leaking your xpub and other PII to Trezor's nodes which may or may not be shared with Wasabi Wallet who in turn may or may not share this information with blockchain analysis companies as described above

  - Set any privacy settings within the application, e.g., enabling Tor to conceal your IP address

  - Another option is to use [Sparrow](https://sparrowwallet.com/ "Sparrow") on desktop instead of Trezor Suite when transacting with Bitcoin

## Running the Scripts üë®‚Äçüíª

To be able to execute the scripts run the following commands:

```sh
chmod u+x verify-trezor-suite.sh
```

```sh
chmod u+x install-trezor-suite.sh
```

Running `chmod u+x` on the files grants only the owner of the file execution permissions.

Then verify Trezor Suite by running:

```sh
./verify-trezor-suite.sh
```

If the verification is successful then install Trezor Suite by running:

```sh
./install-trezor-suite.sh
```
